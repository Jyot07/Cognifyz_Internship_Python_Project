Restaurant Insights &amp; Sentiment Analysis: Data-Driven Exploration

📌 Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of restaurants using Python, with insights extracted on customer ratings, sentiment trends, delivery availability, pricing tiers, and location-based patterns. The goal is to 

uncover actionable and visual insights for food businesses, analysts, and curious minds alike.

🔍 Core Objectives

Identify popular restaurants using vote counts and ratings

Analyze sentiment trends from rating texts

Explore review length and its correlation with rating

Compare service availability (online delivery & table booking) across price ranges

Detect restaurant chains and evaluate their consistency and popularity

Visualize clusters of restaurants based on geographical location

🛠️ Tools Used

Python 🐍 (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

NLP (NLTK, CountVectorizer)

Clustering (DBSCAN)

GitHub for version control & sharing

📊 Key Visuals

Visualizations include scatter plots, bar charts with annotations, sentiment heatmaps, and trend lines that illustrate service vs price range.


💡 Insights

This dataset reveals that:

Some low-rated restaurants had high vote counts, indicating a mismatch between popularity and satisfaction

Higher-priced restaurants often offer more table booking options, while online delivery is popular among mid-priced venues

Chains with fewer outlets sometimes outperform large ones in customer ratings
